[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Oh, woah
Oh, woah
Oh, woah
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber & Ludacris]
You know you love me (Yo), I know you care (Uh-huh)
Just shout whenever (Yo), and I'll be there (Uh-huh)
You are my love (Yo), you are my heart (Uh-huh)
And we will never, ever, ever be apart (Yo, uh-huh)
Are we an item? (Yo) Girl, quit playin' (Uh-huh)
We're just friends (Yo), what are you sayin'? (Uh-huh)
Said, "There's another" (Yo), and looked right in my eyes (Uh-huh)
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like (Yo, uh-huh)
